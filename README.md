## Machine Learning Project: Rock Papers Scissors Image Classifier
### An image classification algorithm developed using Tensorflow on Google Colaboratory

<br> 

This algorithm is able to identify certain hand gestures (mimicking the rock, paper, scissors gestures) with 98,25% accuracy and 0,05% loss. You may also try this Jupyter Notebook file via Google Colab to be able to utilize all the library and features used.

Note: this project is originally made in order to complete the Beginner Machine Learning Class offered by Dicoding and receive a [certification](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/MEPJKNJ7WX3V).
